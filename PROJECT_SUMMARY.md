## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks for maximum performance
- **Web Speech API**: Built-in browser speech recognition and synthesis
- **Service Workers**: PWA caching and offline capabilities
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Responsive mobile-first design

### Key Components

#### Voice Processing (`voice.js`)
- Continuous speech recognition with webkit fallbacks
- End-of-speech detection with configurable silence threshold
- Voice level monitoring with real-time visualization
- Speech synthesis with queue management
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

#### n8n Integration (`n8n.js`)
- HTTP webhook communication layer
- JSON payload formatting and parsing
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Response processing and error handling
- Connection testing and validation

#### iOS Optimizations (`ios-optimizations.js`)
- Device-specific feature detection
- Safe area inset handling
- Keyboard appearance management
- Touch and haptic feedback
- Memory and performance monitoring
- Dynamic Island support

#### Configuration System (`config.js`)
- LocalStorage-based settings persistence
- Input validation and URL verification
- First-run setup wizard
- Settings import/export capabilities

### Performance Optimizations
- **Aggressive Caching**: Service worker caches all assets
- **Hardware Acceleration**: CSS transforms with `translateZ(0)`
