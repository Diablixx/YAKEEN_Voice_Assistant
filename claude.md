# Voice-Controlled n8n Assistant - Implementation Plan

## âœ… Requirements Understood

**Project**: Voice-controlled n8n assistant PWA for iPhone 15 Pro Max

### Core Architecture
- **Speech-to-Text**: Web Speech API with continuous listening
- **Auto-Detection**: Detect when user finishes speaking and immediately send to n8n
- **Text-to-Speech**: Web Speech API for responses
- **n8n Integration**: Direct HTTP webhook calls to cloud n8n instance
- **UI**: Minimal interface with voice visualization and status indicators

### Key Specifications
- **Target Platform**: iPhone 15 Pro Max (iOS PWA)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (public, single user)
- **n8n**: Cloud-hosted, production URL to be provided
- **Voice Flow**: Always listening â†’ Speech detection â†’ Text conversion â†’ n8n webhook â†’ Response â†’ Speech synthesis
- **Authentication**: n8n production URL only (all AI keys in n8n workflows)
- **Use Cases**: Gmail and general voice commands (flexible text passthrough)

### Implementation Strategy
1. Build minimal PWA structure optimized for iOS
2. Implement continuous voice listening with end-of-speech detection
3. Create simple text-to-n8n webhook system
4. Add voice visualization and status indicators
5. Optimize for sub-2 second startup on iPhone
6. Configure for Vercel deployment

## ðŸš€ Ready to Build

All requirements are clear. Ready to implement the complete voice assistant system.

**Next**: Request n8n production URL and begin implementation.
